Copyright 2007 Thomas Off <typo3@retiolum.de>

This extension adds a map from Google Maps to your website. It is based on PHP GoogleMapAPI (http://www.phpinsider.com/php/code/GoogleMapAPI/) by Monte Ohrt which was adapted and partly rewritten to make it more suitable for usage in this extension (e.g. quoting of JavaScript code snippets).

Features:
* Show locations created as tt_address items
* Control the size of the map as well as other behaviour (e.g. whether map controls are shown or not)
* Templatable sidebar which lists the shown locations and can show them in detail once you click on them
* Templatable info box with support for links and graphics
